# SIRFP Integration

Structural Pruning via Spatial-aware Information Redundancy for Semantic Segmentation

Original repository: https://github.com/dywu98/SIRFP.git

## Key Features
- Spatial-aware information redundancy analysis
- Originally designed for semantic segmentation tasks
- Considers spatial relationships in feature maps
- Identifies redundant channels based on spatial information patterns

## Integration Notes
- Adapted from semantic segmentation to work with classification tasks
- Core SIRFP logic preserved: spatial information redundancy analysis
- Simplified for CIFAR-10/ResNet compatibility
- Maintains spatial-aware redundancy detection approach
